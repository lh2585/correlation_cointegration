Trading strategy with two-stage correlation and co-integration 

I implement and expand upon a high frequency and dynamic pairs trading strategy; using a market-neutral statistical arbitrage which employs two-stage correlation and cointegration. The strategy is based on George J. Miaoâ€™s work, High Frequency and Dynamic Pairs Trading (2014). The sample data has been selected from the financial sector for the month of February 2018 at the interval of 1 minute. The optimal strategy yields a return of 2.9% vs -3.8% from S&P 500 for the given time frame.
